# Executive Summary
## Overveiw of Findings

This project analyzes over **100,000 ecommerce** user sessions to evaluate the performance of five key digital marketing channels: Email, Social, Search, Display, and Affiliate. **Affiliate campaigns generated the highest total revenue ($1.52M) and achieved the best revenue-per-session rate ($1.29)**, making them the top-performing channel overall. Search campaigns, while slightly lower in total volume, demonstrated strong efficiency with a **conversion rate of 1.11%** and an **average order value of $34.34**. In contrast, **Email and Display campaigns**, despite high impression counts, showed relatively lower ROI, highlighting opportunities for optimization. These findings offer a clear foundation for prioritizing campaign spend and refining engagement strategies.

**Campaign Performance & ROI Analysis**

- **Social Media** campaigns emerged as the top revenue driver, generating the highest total transaction revenue of $1,453,675 with a conversion efficiency stronger than Email at 3.30%.

- Email campaigns, despite having the highest number of both impressions and sessions (17,475 Impressions & 27,989 Sessions), had a lower conversion yield (3.22%), signaling inefficient ROI likely due to low targeting precision or poor creative performance.

**Sals vs Sessions**

- Affiliate campaigns, with the highest session volume, correlated to the highest revenue, showing higher average order values and fewer items per transaction.

- Search campaigns had fewer sessions but higher avg value, indicating higher intent traffic and stronger product-market fit.
